This is a collection of designs I have been working on for the Convoy S2+ platform.

With these you can go from a reflector or TIR optic to a "mule" configuration, which gives you the widest possible spread and the most even light districution (at the cost of range). 

Mule adapters can be cut from either aluminum or copper depending on wether you prioritize thermals, price or weight. I have been using JLCCNC, where one can upload the files and get an instant quote for the price.
The 16mm and 20mm adapters fit the Convoy 16 and 20mm MCPCBs respectively. 
The cables that are included with Convoy 17mm drivers are enough to clear these adapters, I have not had to replace any cables when using these.

It is recommended to print the gaskets with a material that is resistant to heat. I have been using SLA resins, which has been working very well for me so far. If you are making a UV mule and use a SLA printer, please remember to seal the print so it does not overcure inside the flashlight.
Except for the quad gasket, these parts are made to be used together with the included gasket from Convoy. Without the Convoy gasket you may have a hard time fitting the cables underneath. The quad gaskets have cutouts for cables, be mindful of orientation BEFORE you solder the cables to the MCPCB.

Please use my designs at your own risk, I will not be held responsible if you turn your flaslight into a pipe bomb.
